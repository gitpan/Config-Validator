Config-Validator

This module allows to perform schema based configuration validation.

The idea is to define in a schema what valid data is. This schema can
be used to create a validator object that can in turn be used to make
sure that some data indeed conforms to the schema.

Although the primary focus is on "configuration" (for instance as
provided by modules like Config::General) and, to a lesser extent,
"options" (for instance as provided by modules like Getopt::Long),
this module can in fact validate any data structure.
